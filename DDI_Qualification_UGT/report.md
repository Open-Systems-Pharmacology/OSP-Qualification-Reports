# 1 Introduction
                   

## 1.1 Objective
This **qualification report** evaluates for the PBPK platform **PK-Sim** (as part of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite) the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict UGT1A1- and UGT1A9-mediated drug-drug interactions (**DDI**)

To demonstrate the level of confidence the predictive performance of the platform for this indented purpose is assessed particularly for **inhibition** of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 by selected perpetrators on sensitive substrates . All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing UGT1A1 or UGT1A9, respectively. 

The respective *qualification plan* to produce this *qualification report* is transparently documented and provided open-source (www.open-systems-pharmacology.org). The same applies for all presented PBPK models including *evaluation reports* on model building and evaluation of each model.

*Evaluation reports* including descriptions on model building and detailed evaluations of the included models are documented separately (see [Section 1.2](#12-UGT-DDI-Network)).

Please refer to the [Appendix](#5-Appendix) to learn more details:

- An overview over the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is given in chapter [Section 5.1](#51-Open-Systems-Pharmacology-Suite-(OSPS)-Introduction)

- [Section 5.2](#52-Mathematical-Implementation-of-Drug-Drug-Interactions) shows the implementation of the underlying mathematical equations for drug-drug interactions in the OSP suite.

- A detailed general description of the performed qualification workflow (*qualification plan*, *qualification report*, etc.) can be found in chapter [Section 5.3](#53-Automatic-(re)-qualification-workflow).

# 5 Appendix
                   

## 5.1 Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (OSPS) Introduction
Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (OSP suite) is a tool for PBPK modeling and simulation of drugs in laboratory animals and humans. PK-Sim® and MoBi® are part of the OSP suite [[1](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)].  PK-Sim® is based on a generic PBPK-model with 18 organs and tissues. One of the main assumptions is that all compartments are well-stirred. Represented organs/tissues include arterial and venous blood, adipose tissue (separable adipose, excluding yellow marrow), brain, lung, bone (including yellow marrow), gonads, heart, kidneys, large intestine, liver, muscle, portal vein, pancreas, skin, small intestine, spleen and stomach, as shown in **Figure 1**.

Each organ consists of four sub-compartments namely the plasma, blood cells (which together build the vascular space), interstitial space, and cellular space. Distribution between the plasma and blood cells as well as between the interstitial and cellular compartments can be permeability-limited. In the brain, the permeation barrier is located between the vascular and the interstitial space. PK-Sim® estimates model parameters (intestinal permeability [[2](##References-for-OSPS-introduction)] organ partition coefficients (tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients) [[3,4](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)], and permeabilities) from physico-chemical properties of compounds (molecular weight, pKa, acid/base properties) and the composition of each tissue compartment (lipids, water and proteins). Partition coefficients can be calculated using a variety of methods available in PK-Sim®, for example the internal PK-Sim® method [[3,4](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)] or that of Rodgers and Rowland [[5-7](##References-for-OSPS-introduction)]. 

Physiological databases included in the software incorporate the dependencies of organ composition, organ weights, organ blood flows and gastrointestinal parameters (gastrointestinal length, radius of each section, intestinal surface area, gastrointestinal transit times, and pH in different intestinal segments [[2](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)]), with the user-defined body weight and height and ethnicity of the individual [[8](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)]. Thereby, PK Sim® allows generating realistic virtual populations. For a detailed description of the PBPK model structure implemented in PK Sim®, see Willmann et al. [[2,4,8,9](#References-for-OSPS-introduction)] or the OSP Suite homepage (<https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/mechanistic-modeling-of-pharmacokinetics-and-dynamics/modeling-concepts>).

## 5.2 Mathematical Implementation of Drug-Drug Interactions


**DDI modeling: Competitive inhibition** 

A detailed representation of the mathematical implementation of competitive enzyme inhibition  can be found in the OSP manual [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-compounds-defining-inhibition-induction-processes#competitive-inhibition-simple-setting-with-one-inhibitor).



**DDI modeling: Mechanism-based inhibition**

A detailed representation of the mathematical implementation of mechanism-based enzyme inhibition  can be found in the OSP manual [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-compounds-defining-inhibition-induction-processes#irreversible-inhibition).



**DDI modeling: Induction**

A detailed representation of the mathematical implementation of enzyme induction can be found in the OSP manual [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-compounds-defining-inhibition-induction-processes#enzyme-induction).


## 5.3 Automatic (re)-qualification workflow
[Open Systems Pharmacology](http://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org) provides a dynamic landscape of model repositories and a database of observed clinical data. Additionally, a technical framework to assess confidence of a specific intended use has been developed (qualification runner and reporting engine). This framework allows for an automatic (re)-qualification workflow of the OSP suite, comprising the following steps (**Figure 1**):

- PBPK model development and verification with observed data,

- Qualification plan generation,

- Qualification plan execution,

- Qualification report generation.

  

**Figure 1: OSP suite automatic (re)-qualification workflow**
![OSP qualification workflow](images/OSP_Qualification_Workflow_1.png)



In a first step, the respective qualification scenario is saved in a special qualification repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/). This qualification scenario repository contains a detailed qualification plan that links and combines respective models and data to address the use case that shall be qualified. Therefore, the qualification plan consists of: 

- PK-Sim project files,
- Additional model building steps (if applicable),
- Description of potential cross-dependencies between PK-Sim project files (if applicable),
- Observed data (needed for model development and verification),
- Qualification scenario description text modules
- Detailed report settings to describe the generation of charts and qualification measures. 

PK-Sim projects, observed data sets, and qualification scenario text modules are deposited in distinct repositories and are referenced by the qualification plan (**Figure 2**).



**Figure 2: Qualification scenario repository landscape on GitHub**
![OSP qualification workflow detail](images/OSP_Qualification_Workflow_2.png)



In a second step the [qualification runner](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/QualificationRunner) processes the qualification plan, i.e. all project parts are exported and prepared for the [reporting engine](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Reporting-Engine). The reporting engine provides a validated environment (currently implemented in MATLAB®, a transfer to R is in development) for model execution and finally generates the qualification report. This report contains the evaluation of the individual PBPK models with observed data (i.e. standard goodness of fit plots, visual predictive checks) and a comprehensive qualification of the specific use case assessing the predictive performance of the OSP suite by means of a predefined set of qualification measures and charts. 

The automated execution of the described workflow can be triggered to assess re-qualification in case new data, changes in model structure or parameterization, or new OSP suite releases arise.
